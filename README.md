## **Setting up the development environment**

> First of all [**download** and **install Anaconda package**](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). <br>
> Also **install Git**. Every thing about setting up git and using it can be found in this [**online book**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

### Clone the Repo
> Go to your desired foldar location. Open the terminal and run the following command.
    
    git clone https://github.com/kattelsameer/HandWritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning.git
    

### Import the Environment from YAML file
> Once the repo is cloned go inside the project folder where you will find the environment.yaml file.
> Open the terminal and run the following command to clone the conda environment.
    
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    
### Activate the environment
> Then activate the environment by running the following command.
    
    conda activate digitRecognizer
    
### Deactivate the environment 
> If you want to deactivate the environment, run the following command.
    
    conda deactivate

### Switching back to the base environment
> If you want to switch back to your base environment run the following command.
    
    conda activate
